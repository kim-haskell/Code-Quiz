# Code-Quiz

This code quiz is timed and will ask a series of questions once you click on the "start quiz" button. This will trigger the timer to start and you will be asked multiple choice questions with 4 options. If you get a question wrong, the timer will be reduced by 15 seconds. Once you complete the quiz, your score will pop up and you can enter your initials to submit your scores.
